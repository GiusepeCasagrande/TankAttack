TankAttack
==========

One of the first games that I built, back on 2002 when the only tool I new for it was a Java Applet.

Good memories and not that bad code.

The tank sprite, background and amazing ending ("game over"), all done by myself on Gimp ( I think... )

Thanks to my friend Giacomelli (http://github.com/giacomelli) for helping me think the game structure and even start the code.
